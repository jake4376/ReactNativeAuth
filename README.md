# React Native Authentication App

## Overview

React Native authentication app with Expo and AWS Amplify. 

Users can: sign up, sign in, request a password change, reset the password, navigate between screens, stay logged in and sign out from the app.

Navigation is done with: [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

Back end: [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/).

Front end: [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/).
